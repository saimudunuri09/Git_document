# 🔗 Merging & Conflict Resolution (Real Industry Scenarios)

This file covers **every merging scenario** used by professional developers.

---

# 🧩 1. Simple Merge (Fast-Forward)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/login
git push origin main
🧩 2. Merge with a Commit (No Fast Forward)

Used when you want history.

git merge --no-ff feature/login

🧩 3. Squash Merge

Used to compress multiple commits into one.

git merge --squash feature/login
git commit -m "Add login feature"

🧩 4. Resolving Merge Conflicts

Conflict markers appear:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Your branch content
=======
Their branch content
>>>>>>> feature/login


Solve by editing file manually.

Then:

git add file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"


Abort merge:

git merge --abort

🧩 5. Using VS Code Merge Tool
git mergetool


Configure:

git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd "code --wait $MERGED"

🧩 6. Cherry Pick Commits
git cherry-pick abc1234

🧩 7. Rebase Instead of Merge (Cleaner)
git checkout feature/login
git rebase main


Fix conflicts:

git add .
git rebase --continue


Abort:

git rebase --abort

🧩 8. Merge Strategies
Accept incoming:
git merge -X theirs feature/login

Accept current:
git merge -X ours feature/login

🧩 9. Common Real World Merge Problems
❌ "Your branch has diverged"

Fix:

git pull --rebase origin main

❌ "Refusing to merge unrelated histories"

Fix:

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

🧩 10. Merge Best Practices

Pull latest main before merging

Resolve conflicts locally

Never commit conflict markers

Prefer PR-based merging

Use squash merge for long feature branches

NEVER force push to main
