# 🏆 Git Best Practices (Industry Standard)

These are **enterprise-grade practices** used by companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Netflix, and Salesforce.

Keeping your Git clean = fewer bugs + easier reviews + faster deployments.

---

# 🧱 1. Commit Best Practices

### ✔ Write meaningful commit messages

Good:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT-based login"
git commit -m "fix(cart): resolve checkout crash issue"
git commit -m "docs(api): update rate limit examples"
Bad:

git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "changes"

✔ Keep commits small & focused

Each commit should contain one logical change, not everything.

📛 2. Branch Naming Conventions

Use prefix + description format.

Examples:

feature/user-authentication
feature/add-payment-gateway
bugfix/order-total-calculation
hotfix/production-crash
release/v2.3.1
docs/update-readme
refactor/improve-db-performance
test/add-pipeline-tests

📁 3. .gitignore Best Practices

Example:

# Dependencies
node_modules/
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.log

# Env
.env
.env.local

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

🔀 4. Pull Request Best Practices

Every PR should include:

Small & focused changes

Clean commit history

Clear title

Description of what changed

Tests included

No console.logs

No commented-out code

Linked issues

Screenshots (for UI changes)

📌 PR Template
## What
Explain what this PR does.

## Why
Explain why this change is needed.

## How
Explain your approach or logic.

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing done

🧩 5. Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits)
<type>(<scope>): <subject>


Types:

feat → New feature

fix → Bug fix

docs → Documentation

style → Formatting changes

refactor → Code restructure

test → Adding tests

chore → Maintenance tasks

Example:

feat(auth): implement OTP-based login

📐 6. Repository Structure (Recommended)
project/
├── src/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── .github/workflows/  
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
└── LICENSE

🔒 7. Security Best Practices

❌ Never commit:

API keys / tokens

AWS access keys

Database passwords

Private keys

.env files

Personal data

✔ Always use:

.env + .gitignore

Secret manager (AWS/GCP/Azure)

GitHub Actions encrypted secrets

🧪 8. Code Review Checklist

Before requesting review:

 Code compiles

 Tests pass

 No dead code

 No console.logs

 Feature works end-to-end

 Documentation updated

 Branch is up-to-date

 No sensitive data

🚀 9. Workflow Best Practices

Daily rules:

Pull before starting work

Create a feature branch

Make small commits

Push frequently

Create PR when done

Delete branch after merge

💾 10. Performance Tips
git gc --auto
git remote prune origin
git count-objects -vH

❌ 11. Common Mistakes to Avoid

Never:

Commit directly to main

Force push to main

Keep large binary files in repo

Keep long-running branches

Merge without review

Make huge PRs (>200 lines)

Push incomplete work without feature flags

✔ Professional Checklist

 Structured repository

 Small & clean commits

 Standardized naming

 Secure secrets

 Clear PR workflow
