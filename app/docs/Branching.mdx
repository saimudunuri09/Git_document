# 🌱 Branching Strategies & Real-World Scenarios

Branching is the **heart** of enterprise Git workflow.  
Every company uses branches differently, but common patterns exist.

This guide covers **all scenarios**.

---

# 🧬 Branch Types Used in Industry

### ✔ `main`  
Production-ready code  
Deployable at all times

### ✔ `develop`  
Integration branch (Git Flow teams)

### ✔ `feature/*`  
For new features

### ✔ `bugfix/*`  
For non-critical bugs

### ✔ `hotfix/*`  
For urgent production fixes

### ✔ `release/*`  
Used for preparing releases

# 🧩 1. Create New Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/login-system
🧩 2. Create a Branch from Specific Commit

Useful in debugging and recreation.

git checkout -b test-branch abc1234

🧩 3. Rename a Branch

While on branch:

git branch -m new-name


Rename another branch:

git branch -m old-name new-name


Update remote name:

git push origin :old-name new-name
git push origin -u new-name

🧩 4. Delete Branches

Local delete:

git branch -d feature/login


Force delete:

git branch -D feature/login


Remote delete:

git push origin --delete feature/login

🧩 5. Track Remote Branch (MOST COMMON)
git checkout --track origin/feature/login

🧩 6. Compare Branches
git diff main..feature/login


Compact commit list:

git log --oneline main..feature/login

🧩 7. Git Flow Workflow (Used in Large Companies)
main
develop
feature/*
release/*
hotfix/*


Example:

git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/user-profile


Finish feature:

git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-profile

🧩 8. GitHub Flow (Used in Startups)

Simplest model:

main
feature/*


Steps:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/add-search
git push -u origin feature/add-search


Then create PR.

🧩 9. Trunk-Based Development (Used by Google, Meta)

Rules:

Work on VERY SHORT branches

Merge every few hours

Feature flags required

🧩 10. Branching Best Practices

Always branch from latest main

Use meaningful names

Delete merged branches

Push often

Don't keep long-running branches

Prefer feature flags for incomplete features

Rebase often to keep clean history
